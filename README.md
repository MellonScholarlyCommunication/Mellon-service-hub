## Mellon Service Hub

This is an POC implementation for a Service Hub in a decentralized network.

This hub is planned to include all 4 essential services:
- Archiving
- Awareness
- Certification
- Registration

More documentation coming soon, this is still very much a work in progress!

CLI interface available through:
```node bin/servicehub.js```
